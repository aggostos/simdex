# Scenario where user experience based on job latency is the top criterium.
# Short jobs needs to be evaluated almost interactively, long jobs may be delayed much longer.
# The objective is achieved by imposing limits on queues, only jobs that are expected to
# take no more than given limit are allowed in (all queues remain active the whole time).
# The key part of the scenario is the duration estimation algorithm used by dispatcher.

# This configuration uses job dispatcher and SA strategy that estimates job duration
# based on previous jobs (including ref. jobs). The SA fills an index (estimation structure),
# dispatcher uses the duration index to make the estimates.


# Workers could be either a number or a list that explicitly states a collection of attributes
# If only a number is given, the workers are initialized with no attributes at the beginning.
workers:
  - active: true
  - active: true
    limit: 30.0
  - active: true
    limit: 30.0
  - active: true
    limit: 30.0
