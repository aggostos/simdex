# Configuration with simple dispatcher and no self-adaptive strategy (ref. baseline).
# This configuration makes only 1 worker active and since there is no SA, other 3 remain inactive the whole time.

# Workers could be either a number or a list that explicitly states a collection of attributes
# If only a number is given, the workers are initialized with no attributes at the beginning.
workers:
  - active: true
  - active: false
  - active: false
  - active: false

# dispatcher component: either a string (fully qualified class name) or a collection with { class, args }
# where class is fully qualified class name and args is list or dict holding constructor arguments
dispatcher: experiments.simple.dispatcher.SimpleDispatcher

# list of metric components (each one is in the same format as dispatcher)
metrics:
  - metrics.default.JobDelayMetricsCollector
  - metrics.default.PowerMetricsCollector
